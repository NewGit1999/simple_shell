## Background Context
* Write a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
### General
* Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
* Who is Ken Thompson
* How does a shell work
* What is a pid and a ppid
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What is the difference between a function and a system call
* How to create processes
* What are the three prototypes of main
* How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
* How to execute another program with the execve system call
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
* What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* Use system calls only when you need to (why?)
* Write a README with the description of your project
* You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. Format, see [Docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/AUTHORS)
## More Info
### Output
* Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.
* The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0] (See below)
